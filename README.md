Develop a small iOS application composed of two screens: list and detail.


VIPER architecture
Simple NSURLSession + Decodable
Pagination: As I don't know the number of elements in advance, I go with a simple pagination: If I am almost at the bottom (i.e.: 10 elements to arrive to the bottom), I fetch next page.
